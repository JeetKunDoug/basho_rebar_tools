Files in this directory are sourced by the plugin in various ways and must not
be modified without understanding how they're used.

default.basho.mk
----------------
This is the body of the "standard" Basho Makefile for use in Erlang projects.

The copyright header is prepended with the appropriate year [range] by the
plugin, and additional targets *may* be appended for certain dependencies and
projects.

Only semantic comments are appropriate in this file, as the contents will be
included verbatim in generated/updated files.

The contents of this file are highly dependent on the standard rebar.config's
profiles - refer to the default.rebar.config file in this directory for
details.

default.*.config
----------------
These are Erlang terms that form the beginnings of generated/updated files
with matching names less the "default." prefix, or their logical equivalents.

Note that these read as terms only, using file:consult/1, so comments in them
are not included in generated files.
